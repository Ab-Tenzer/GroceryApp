## About The App
The Grocery app is built with Ignite CLI and simply allows you to Sign in, then it takes you through the onboarding process. 
Inside the app you'll have a Home screen where you get a list of available products which you can add to your cart. 
The Cart resides on a different screen. It has a tab icon that shows the basket total.
